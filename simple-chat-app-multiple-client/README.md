Simple Chat App (Multi Client)
==============================
<h2>Default Values</h2>
IP address: 127.0.0.1<br>
Port: 4444<br>
Username: User<br>

You can edit above values in the script. But you need to edit both client and server script.<br>

Tested on Windows.

<h2>How to Use</h2>
<h4>Default Mode</h4>
Running server: python3 multiple-chat-app-server.py<br>
Running client: python3 multiple-chat-app-client.py<br>

To exit client connection press Ctrl+C.<br>

There are a few errors that hasn't been handled when exiting the apps.<br>
Anyway, just have fun.
